# Customer-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis-using-Descriptive-Statistics
In the Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics project, we embark on a journey to uncover valuable insights into the purchasing habits and preferences of our customers. Leveraging the power of descriptive statistics, we dive deep into our dataset to extract meaningful information that can drive strategic decision-making and enhance the customer experience.

Descriptive statistics offer a powerful toolkit for summarizing and visualizing key aspects of our data. Through this project, we harness these tools to gain a comprehensive understanding of various facets of customer behavior, including purchasing frequency, spending patterns, product preferences, and more.
